# Thecel_phares
A "by 1-10-100" 6.5 GHz max programmable divider/prescaler for frequency meter. 

Mane Thecel Phares (Counted, Weighed, Divided in ancient Hebraic) is a programable prescaler 
able to divide by 1 (no division), by 10 or by 100 any frequency under 6.5 GHz. 

This kind of module can transform an old 50 MHz (or less) frequency meter in a modern high-end 5 GHz class instrument for
a minimal investment. 

The heart of this project is a pair of Hittite (now Analog Device) HMC705, a programmable divider by 1 to 17 specified 
at 6.5 GHz with a Ultra Low SS B Phase Noise Floor of -153 dBc/Hz @ 100 kHz.
Each I.C. is sold around 50 USD, meaning tha with a little bit more than 100 to 150 USD, you can upgrade
any old but still good reciprocal counter. 

The only difficulty is to solder a rather small QFN IC with 24 "leads" on a 4x4 mm package. 

Each I.C. needs a little bit less than 200 mA (400 mA for the whole design). Any 5V ldo would be able to supply the needed voltage and current. 

Enjoy

ps : Why such a name ? because any frequency prescaler is able to wheight, count and divide -it's primary function after all-. I'ts also a reference
of Philip K. Dick novel "A maze of death".
